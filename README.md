Day planner assignment HTML was created using bootstrap and time log using moment.js. Bootstrap is an excellent dynamic to aid site configuration, that, paired with moment.js really makes accessing time and making a well designed web page much more convineient and more efficient. My biggest takeaway from this is grasping a better understanding of jQuery and how to manipulate items from there to place in HTML


## Usage 

This application is very simple to use, it tracks time and color codes it by past present and future. Simply type in a note in a time block, click the save icon on the right side of the page and the data will be saved to local storage.
